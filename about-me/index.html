    <p>Hello all,</p>
    <p>I'm currently in Minnesota, though I was born and raised in Pennsylvania. Something interesting about me, I've always been technology inclined and enjoyed programming/coding ever since a young age. I enjoy the weather in the fall, it's not too hot or too cold, good weather for casual bike rides. Hope to get out of this course working with front-end development. Looking forward to learning together in this course.</p>
